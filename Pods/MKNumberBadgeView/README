iPhoneMK is a loose collection of Objective-C classes for the iPhone SDK that I have put together over time which I feel might be of general utility to people. The classes are released under the Apache 2.0 license.

If you find any of these classes useful, I'd love to hear about it. If you have improvements for any of them, feel free to commit your changes, however, I ask that you try not to change existing interface.
